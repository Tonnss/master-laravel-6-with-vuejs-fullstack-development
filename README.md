This is my personal learning log of Udemy course, [Master Laravel 6 with Vue.js Fullstack Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-laravel-6-with-vuejs-fullstack-development/), created by Piotr Jura.
Following is the description from Udemy course.

## Description
### Learn Laravel together with Vue.js in this brand new, full-stack, project based course!

Learn how to create a robust API in Laravel and a Single Page Application frontend in Vue.js!

As with my other courses, you will start straight away with creating a project. During the course you will build a booking page, similar to very popular online booking websites!

No time wasted on so called "theory". I did by best and went extra mile, to explain everything that you need to learn by practical examples. It's not one of these courses when instructor in the first 10 hours reads the documentation out loud.

### Topics covered include:

from Laravel: Controllers, Eloquent, Query Scopes, Model Events, HTTP resouces.

from Vue: Vue Router, Vue Components, Vuex (global state management).

Don't waste your time and money anymore, this course is the only resource you need to get up to speed with full-stack development using Laravel Framework 6+ and Vue.js!

### Who this course is for:
- PHP developers looking to learn Laravel to build APIs
- JavaScript developers wanting to start with Vue that have PHP basics
- Laravel developers wanting to enhance their skills by learning how to work with Vue
